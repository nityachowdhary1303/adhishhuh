    <h1>Hi Adhish,</h1>
    Youâ€™re 24 nowâ€¦ so old omg. But listen, Iâ€™m really happy to have you in my life. Weâ€™ve actually come a long way and Iâ€™m glad we did, because this means a lot to me. You matter to me. A lot.<br><br>
    You should stop teasing meâ€¦ but also donâ€™t.<br><br>
    Iâ€™ll always be on your side. I know youâ€™ll be on mine too. I canâ€™t wait for more memories with you, especially when you finally come to Bangalore. I really hope that trip happens the way we imagine it, because I want all of it: the laughs, the roaming, the stupid conversations, everything.<br><br>
    And about that one day I made you upset, I was honestly so worried. I really donâ€™t want to see you like that again. Iâ€™ll try my best to never let that happen. Youâ€™re too important.<br><br>
    Itâ€™s crazy how you ended up being this special. I still remember the first time I came to your Bangalore flat, when we werenâ€™t even close. Us walking down your lane, smoking, talking about life. And all those small moments after, chilling, drinking, music, just talking,they stayed with me.<br><br>
    And right now, youâ€™re working (while I was struggling to make this website). Youâ€™re always working. Youâ€™re so disciplined in your own way and I genuinely admire that about you. I hope I learn some of that from you. I genuinely believe youâ€™ll get everything youâ€™re working for. You deserve to see your dreams come true.<br><br>
    Chalo, enough tareef for you. Donâ€™t get used to it.<br>
    Also stop annoying me (but also donâ€™t).<br>
    And donâ€™t be sad, huh.<br><br>
    Only 7 more days for me to be here, uske baad Iâ€™ll wait for you to be in Bangalore, and for us to go on that trip. Iâ€™m way too excited huh.<br><br>
    Happiest Birthday to you.<br>
    I really wish you the best, in everything.<br><br>
    I know you donâ€™t get excited about your birthdays, but I am excited for you.ðŸ’›
    I wish I was there with you right now, I wish I could spend the whole night w you. Had so much fun today yaaar!!!! I know time passed bahut jaldi se but we got a spot hehe!!<br> 
    I miss you way too much! the tightest hug I could ever give!<br><br>
    With me in your year<br>
    Always
    <br><br>
